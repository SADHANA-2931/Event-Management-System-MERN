College Event Management System
A Smart College Event Management System- Designed with a focus on campus-level event coordination, the platform simplifies everything from planning and approvals to ticket booking and QR-based verification.

About the Project

It was created to bridge the gap between event organizers and attendees in educational institutions. With features like **event scheduling, ticket booking, and QR code verification**, we aimed to deliver a seamless experience for both ends.

We built this system using the MERN stack(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) while following agile Scrum methodology throughout development.
